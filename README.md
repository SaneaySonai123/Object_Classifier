# Object_Classifier
The proposed object classifier holds great potential for real-world applications, such as object recognition in surveillance systems, object detection in autonomous vehicles, or content-based image retrieval. Its versatility lies in the flexibility of OpenCV for feature extraction and the robustness of scikit-learn for classification tasks.
